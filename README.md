# WebGAM
Web frontend for GAM (Google Apps Manager).  The goal is to provide a cleaner &amp; more functional web based interface for managing your Google Apps domain than what is available using only Google's Admin Console.

This project is still in the beta stages & may not yet be suitable for managing your production Google Apps domains.  Read the documentation & test in a suitable environment prior to use in your production domains.
